# üöÄ Quick Start Guide - Agentic AI Framework

Get your AI agent framework running in **10 minutes** with this step-by-step guide!

## ‚ö° What You'll Build

By the end of this guide, you'll have:
- ‚úÖ A running AI agent framework
- ‚úÖ A website monitoring agent that can check if sites are online
- ‚úÖ An automated workflow that monitors websites and sends alerts
- ‚úÖ A scheduled task that runs monitoring every 5 minutes

## üìã Prerequisites (2 minutes)

**What you need:**
- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- 4GB+ available RAM
- Internet connection
- A terminal/command prompt

**Don't have Docker?** Install it quickly:
- **Windows/Mac**: [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- **Linux**: `curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh && sh get-docker.sh`

## üéØ Step 1: Get the Framework Running (3 minutes)

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/agentic-ai-framework.git
cd agentic-ai-framework

# 2. Start the framework (this downloads models automatically)
docker-compose up -d

# 3. Wait for the models to download (grab a coffee ‚òï)
# This takes 3-5 minutes depending on your internet speed
docker-compose logs -f model-downloader
```

**‚è≥ While waiting**, the framework is downloading these AI models:
- `granite3.2:2b` (700MB) - Your main AI brain
- `deepseek-r1:1.5b` (1.1GB) - For reasoning and tool usage
- `tinyllama:1.1b` (637MB) - Lightweight backup model

**‚úÖ Success indicators:**
- No error messages in the logs
- Models downloaded successfully
- All containers running

## üéØ Step 2: Verify Everything Works (1 minute)

```bash
# Check system health
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# Should return something like:
# {
#   "status": "healthy",
#   "timestamp": "2024-06-05T14:30:00Z",
#   "ollama_status": true,
#   "memory_entries": 0
# }

# Check available AI models
curl http://localhost:8000/models

# Should return a list like:
# ["granite3.2:2b", "deepseek-r1:1.5b", "tinyllama:1.1b"]
```

**üåê Access the interactive docs:**
Open your browser and go to: **http://localhost:8000/docs**

This gives you a complete interactive interface to test all API endpoints!

## üéØ Step 3: Create Your First AI Agent (2 minutes)

Let's create a website monitoring agent that can check if websites are online:

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/agents" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "website_guardian",
    "role": "Website Monitoring Specialist",
    "goals": "Monitor websites and report their status accurately",
    "backstory": "You are an experienced system administrator who specializes in monitoring web services. You check websites systematically and provide clear status reports.",
    "tools": ["website_monitor"],
    "ollama_model": "granite3.2:2b",
    "enabled": true
  }'
```

**‚úÖ Expected response:**
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "website_guardian", 
  "message": "Agent created successfully"
}
```

## üéØ Step 4: Test Your Agent (1 minute)

Now let's test our agent by asking it to check if Google is online:

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/agents/website_guardian/execute" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "task": "Check if https://google.com is online and tell me the response time",
    "context": {}
  }'
```

**‚úÖ Expected response (after ~10-30 seconds):**
```json
{
  "agent_name": "website_guardian",
  "task": "Check if https://google.com is online and tell me the response time", 
  "result": "I checked https://google.com and it is online. The website responded with HTTP status 200 in 156ms. The website is functioning normally.",
  "timestamp": "2024-06-05T14:35:00Z"
}
```

**üéâ Congratulations!** Your AI agent just:
1. Understood your request
2. Used the website monitoring tool
3. Checked Google's status
4. Reported back with detailed results

## üéØ Step 5: Create an Advanced Workflow (2 minutes)

Let's create a workflow that monitors multiple websites and makes decisions:

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/workflows" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "multi_site_monitor",
    "description": "Monitor multiple critical websites",
    "steps": [
      {
        "type": "tool",
        "name": "website_monitor",
        "parameters": {
          "url": "https://google.com",
          "expected_status": 200,
          "timeout": 10
        },
        "context_key": "google_status"
      },
      {
        "type": "tool", 
        "name": "website_monitor",
        "parameters": {
          "url": "https://github.com",
          "expected_status": 200,
          "timeout": 10
        },
        "context_key": "github_status"
      },
      {
        "type": "agent",
        "name": "website_guardian",
        "task": "Analyze these website statuses: Google: {google_status}, GitHub: {github_status}. Provide a summary report of which sites are online and any issues detected.",
        "context_key": "summary_report"
      }
    ],
    "enabled": true
  }'
```

**Test the workflow:**
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/workflows/multi_site_monitor/execute" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"context": {}}'
```

**‚úÖ What happens:**
1. Checks Google.com status
2. Checks GitHub.com status  
3. AI agent analyzes both results
4. Provides intelligent summary report

## üéØ Step 6: Schedule Automated Monitoring (1 minute)

Let's schedule our workflow to run automatically every 5 minutes:

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/schedule" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "task_type": "workflow",
    "workflow_name": "multi_site_monitor", 
    "scheduled_time": "2024-12-20T10:00:00Z",
    "context": {
      "recurring": "every_5_minutes",
      "description": "Automated website monitoring"
    }
  }'
```

**‚úÖ Result:** Your workflow now runs automatically every 5 minutes, monitoring your websites and generating intelligent reports!

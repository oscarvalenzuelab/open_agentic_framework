# Workflows Documentation

This section contains documentation for workflow templates and examples available in the Open Agentic Framework. Workflows are the core building blocks that combine multiple tools and agents to create automated processes.

## üìã Available Workflows

### üîÑ Email-Based Workflows

#### [Email Reply Workflow](EMAIL_REPLY_WORKFLOW.md)
Automated email processing and response system:
- Email parsing and analysis
- Automated response generation
- Attachment handling
- Reply sending with results

## üöÄ Creating New Workflows

### 1. Workflow Structure
Workflows are defined as JSON configurations with the following structure:

```json
{
  "name": "My Workflow",
  "description": "Description of what this workflow does",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "steps": [
    {
      "id": "step1",
      "name": "First Step",
      "tool": "tool_name",
      "config": {
        "param1": "value1",
        "param2": "value2"
      },
      "input": {
        "source": "workflow_input",
        "field": "data_field"
      }
    },
    {
      "id": "step2",
      "name": "Second Step",
      "tool": "another_tool",
      "config": {},
      "input": {
        "source": "step_output",
        "step": "step1",
        "field": "result"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. Workflow Categories

#### Communication Workflows
- Email processing and responses
- *Future: Slack notifications, SMS alerts, webhook integrations*

#### Data Processing Workflows
- File processing and analysis
- *Future: ETL pipelines, data validation, report generation*

#### Monitoring Workflows
- System and service monitoring
- *Future: Performance tracking, alert management, log analysis*

#### AI/ML Workflows
- Model training and inference
- *Future: Data preprocessing, model evaluation, automated ML*

#### Security Workflows
- Threat detection and response
- *Future: Vulnerability scanning, access control, audit logging*

### 3. Workflow Design Principles

#### Modularity
- Break complex workflows into smaller, reusable steps
- Use clear input/output contracts between steps
- Design steps to be independently testable

#### Error Handling
- Include error handling at each step
- Provide fallback mechanisms
- Log errors with sufficient context

#### Performance
- Consider parallel execution where possible
- Optimize data flow between steps
- Monitor workflow execution times

#### Security
- Validate all inputs
- Sanitize data between steps
- Use secure configuration management

### 4. Workflow Development Process

1. **Define Requirements**: What should the workflow accomplish?
2. **Design Steps**: Break down into logical steps
3. **Choose Tools**: Select appropriate tools for each step
4. **Configure**: Set up tool parameters and data flow
5. **Test**: Validate with sample data
6. **Document**: Create comprehensive documentation
7. **Deploy**: Make available for use

### 5. Testing Workflows

#### Unit Testing
- Test individual steps with mock data
- Validate input/output contracts
- Test error conditions

#### Integration Testing
- Test complete workflow execution
- Validate end-to-end functionality
- Test with real data samples

#### Performance Testing
- Measure execution times
- Test with large datasets
- Identify bottlenecks

## üìÅ Workflow Templates

### Basic Email Processing
```json
{
  "name": "Basic Email Processing",
  "steps": [
    {
      "id": "parse_email",
      "tool": "email_parser",
      "input": {"source": "workflow_input"}
    },
    {
      "id": "process_content",
      "tool": "data_extractor",
      "input": {"source": "step_output", "step": "parse_email"}
    }
  ]
}
```

### File Processing Pipeline
```json
{
  "name": "File Processing Pipeline",
  "steps": [
    {
      "id": "store_file",
      "tool": "file_vault",
      "input": {"source": "workflow_input"}
    },
    {
      "id": "extract_data",
      "tool": "data_extractor",
      "input": {"source": "step_output", "step": "store_file"}
    }
  ]
}
```

## ü§ù Contributing Workflows

When contributing new workflows:

1. **Follow Standards**: Use consistent naming and structure
2. **Document**: Include comprehensive documentation
3. **Test**: Provide test cases and examples
4. **Optimize**: Consider performance and resource usage
5. **Secure**: Follow security best practices

## üìä Workflow Monitoring

### Metrics to Track
- Execution time per step
- Success/failure rates
- Resource usage
- Error patterns

### Logging
- Step execution logs
- Input/output data (sanitized)
- Error details
- Performance metrics

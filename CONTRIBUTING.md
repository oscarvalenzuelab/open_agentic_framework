- **Git**
- **Text editor or IDE** (VS Code, PyCharm, etc.)
- **4GB+ RAM** for running models locally

### Local Setup

```bash
# 1. Fork the repository on GitHub
# 2. Clone your fork locally
git clone https://github.com/oscarvalenzuelab/open_agentic_framework.git
cd open_agentic_framework

# 3. Add upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/oscarvalenzuelab/open_agentic_framework.git

```

### Development Tools

We use several tools to maintain code quality:

- **Black** - Code formatting
- **isort** - Import sorting
- **flake8** - Linting
- **mypy** - Type checking

#### New Tools

Creating a new tool is a great way to contribute! Tools extend agent capabilities:

```python
# Example: tools/my_awesome_tool.py
from tools.base_tool import BaseTool
from typing import Dict, Any

class MyAwesomeTool(BaseTool):
    @property
    def name(self) -> str:
        return "my_awesome_tool"
    
    @property
    def description(self) -> str:
        return "Does something awesome for agents"
    
    @property
    def parameters(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        return {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "input_text": {
                    "type": "string",
                    "description": "Text to process"
                },
                "option": {
                    "type": "string",
                    "enum": ["fast", "thorough"],
                    "default": "fast"
                }
            },
            "required": ["input_text"]
        }
    
    async def execute(self, parameters: Dict[str, Any]) -> Any:
        """Execute the tool with given parameters"""
        input_text = parameters["input_text"]
        option = parameters.get("option", "fast")
        
        # Your tool logic here
        result = f"Processed '{input_text}' with {option} mode"
        
        return {
            "result": result,
            "processed_length": len(input_text),
            "mode": option
        }
```

## ‚ùì FAQ

### Q: I'm new to open source. How can I contribute?

**A:** Start small! Look for issues labeled `good first issue` or `help wanted`. Documentation improvements and bug reports are great first contributions.

### Q: Can I add support for a new LLM provider?

**A:** Absolutely! We welcome integrations with different LLM providers. Please create an issue first to discuss the implementation approach.

### Q: How do I create a custom tool?

**A:** Check out the [tool creation guide](README.md#creating-custom-tools) and look at existing tools in the `tools/` directory for examples.

### Q: What if my PR gets rejected?

**A:** Feedback is part of the process! We'll provide specific suggestions for improvement. Don't take it personally - we're all working together to make the project better.
